Kemy : An AQM generator based on machine learning. (ns-3)

The main aim of this project is to implement Kemy framework in ns-3. Active queue management (AQM) plays an important role in network congestion control, has been proved necessary for avoiding congestion.

In the recent times as the widespread bufferbloat being exposed, AQM has been paid more and more attention. However manually designed AQMs still pose some problems especially in parameter-tuning and scenarios adaption.

Kemy based on off-line machine learning technologies is evaluated in various scenarios and achieves the goals of solving bufferbloat problem. Compared to some other human-designed AQMs, Kemy-generated AQM performs even better in some cases.
